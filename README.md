# monument
A projection mapping collab with artist Annie Kuhn

We're mapping a projection over a floating pyramid as an installation piece. Video cameras in the viewing space will trigger from the signal of motion/depth sensors in reaction to viewers movements around the monument, and this app will process the video into projection content. The viewer will see themselves projected around the room, their image divided, mutated, refracted, etc. Sound elements may also become programmatic and reactive as the project progresses.
